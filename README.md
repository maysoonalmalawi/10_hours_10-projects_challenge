I did the JavaScript 10 Projects in 10 hours with Florin Pop, but for me more as a learning process than an actual timed challenge.

You can find the recording of his live video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&t=20514s 

I will be committing the projects as I finish them here:

1- Coutndown Timer
* A simple countdowd app to any date specified in the .js file

2- Recipes App
* A recipes app that uses an API to generate recipes.
* It has a (fav) feature where the user can have favorite recipes in one place.
* It has a (search) feature where the user can search for a specific ingredient to find recipes that use it.

3- Quiz App
* A quiz app that displays how many correct answers the user got at the end.
* You can change the questions in the .js file but in my file I chose to use programming relative questions.

4- Notes App
* An easy notes app to add and delete notes.
* It uses local storage to keep record of past notes.

5- To-Do App
* An easy to-do list app to add, toggle, and delete to-do items.
* It uses local storage to keep record of past items.

6- Movies App
* A movies app that uses an API to generate movies posters and info.
* It classifies movies according to their rating using three colors: red, orange, and green.
* It has a (search) feature where the user can search for movies using keywords.
